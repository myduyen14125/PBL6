The script files have been bundled into data/databundles/scripts.zip

Modders, or the curious, are free to unzip the file and view the scripts. 
Don't Starve Together will continue to load the zip file, even when the files are unzipped. This is keeps the boot times down. 

Here are the steps to load the unzipped files (this is not advised but some modders may find this to be an easier way to experement, before making a mod):
- Close Don't Starve Together if it is running
- Ensure the extracted files are located under data/scripts and not data/scripts/scripts/
- Rename data/databundles/scripts.zip to something else (eg data/databundles/backup_scripts.zip)
- Run Don't Starve Together
- Note: If Don't Starve Together receives an update while data/databundles/scripts.zip was renamed, a new version of scripts.zip will be downloaded. 
        In this case, delete backup_scripts.zip and run these steps again.

To restore loading the original data/databundles/scripts.zip file:
- Close Don't Starve Together if it is running
- Rename data/databundles/backup_scripts.zip to data/databundles/scripts.zip 
- Run Don't Starve Together
- Note: The modified data/scripts/ files will remain but not be used
